# Zeus Lottery
Zeus Lottery is a decentralized lottery system built on the Ethereum blockchain. This Github project provides the necessary code to run and test the project locally using Docker Compose.

## Prerequisites
To run Zeus Lottery locally, you'll need the following:

- Docker: You can download and install Docker from the official website.
- Git: You can download and install Git from the official website.

## Getting Started
To get started with Zeus Lottery, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/Blockchain-Zeus/Zeus-Lottery.git
```
Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd zeus-lottery
```
